  The goal of this homework assignment is to allow you to practice using
  [Python] to create scripts that require sophisticated parsing of data and
  manipulation of [data structures].  In this assignment, you will download
  data in both [CSV] and [JSON] format, process it, and then present it to the
  user in the terminal.

  For this assignment, record your scripts and any responses to the following
  activities in the `homework05` folder of your **assignments** [GitHub]
  repository and push your work by **noon Saturday, February 26**.

  [Python]:     https://www.python.org/
  [JSON]:       https://json.org/
  [CSV]:        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values
  [data structures]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure

  ## Activity 0: Preparation

  Before starting this homework assignment, you should first perform a `git
  pull` to retrieve any changes in your remote [GitHub] repository:

      :::bash
      $ cd path/to/repository                   # Go to assignments repository

      $ git checkout master                     # Make sure we are in master branch

      $ git pull --rebase                       # Get any remote changes not present locally

  Next, create a new branch for this assignment:

      :::bash
      $ git checkout -b homework05              # Create homework05 branch and check it out

  Once this is done, download the `Makefile` and test scripts:

      :::bash
      # Go to homework05 folder
      $ cd homework05

      # Download the Makefile
      $ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nd-cse-20289-sp22/cse-20289-sp22-assignments/master/homework05/Makefile

      # Add and commit Makefile
      $ git add Makefile
      $ git commit -m "homework05: add Makefile"

      # Download the test scripts
      $ make test-scripts

  You are now ready to work on the activities below.

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  **Note**, you do not need to add and commit the test scripts since the
  Makefile will automaticaly download them again whenever you run make.
  </div>

  ## Activity 1: Reddit (5 Points)

  Katie likes to sit in the back of the class.  It has its **perks**:

  - She can beat the rush out the door when class ends.

  - She can see everyone browsing Facebook, playing video games[^1], watching
    YouTube, or doing homework.

  - She feels safe from being called upon by the instructor... except when he
    does that strange thing where he goes around the class and tries to talk to
    people.  Totally weird [^2].

  That said, sitting in the back has its **downsides**:

  - She can never see what the instructor is writing because he has terrible
    handwriting and always writes too small [^3].

  - She is prone to falling asleep because the instructor is really boring and
    the class is not as interesting as her other computer science courses.

  To combat her boredom, Katie typically just browses [Reddit].  Her favorite
  [subreddits] are [AdviceAnimals], [aww], [todayilearned], and of course
  [UnixPorn].  Lately, however, Katie has grown paranoid that her web browser
  is leaking information about her[^4], and so she wants to be able to get the
  latest links from [Reddit] directly in her terminal.

  Fortunately for Katie, [Reddit] provides a [JSON] feed for every subreddit.
  You simply need to append `.json` to the end of each subreddit.  For
  instance, the [JSON] feed for [todayilearned] can be found here:

      :::text
      https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/.json

  To fetch that data, Katie uses the [Requests] package in [Python] to access
  the [JSON] data:

      :::python
      r = requests.get('https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/.json')
      print(r.json())

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-reddit"></i> 429 Too Many Requests

  [Reddit] tries to prevent bots from accessing its website too often.  To work
  around any **429: Too Many Requests** errors, we can trick [Reddit] by
  specifying our own user agent:<br><br>

      :::python
      headers  = {'user-agent': 'reddit-{}'.format(os.environ.get('USER', 'cse-20289-sp22'))}
      response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

  This should allow you to make requests without getting the dreaded **429**
  error.

  </div>

  The code above would output something like the following:

      :::json
      {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "g8n3uwtdj363d5abd2cbdf61ed1aef6e2825c29dae8c9fa113", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": ...

  Looking through that stream of text, Katie sees that the [JSON] data is a
  collection of structured or hierarchical [dictionaries] and [lists].  This
  looks a bit complex to her, so she wants you to help her complete the
  `reddit.py` script which fetches the [JSON] data for a specified
  **subreddit** or **URL** and allows the user to sort the articles by various
  fields, restrict the number of items displayed, and even shorten the **URLs**
  of each article.

  ### Task 1: `reddit.py`

  The `reddit.py` script takes the following arguments:

      :::text
      $ ./reddit.py
      Usage: reddit.py [options] URL_OR_SUBREDDIT

          -s          Shorten URLs using (default: False)
          -n LIMIT    Number of articles to display (default: 10)
          -o ORDERBY  Field to sort articles by (default: score)
          -t TITLELEN Truncate title to specified length (default: 60)

  The `-s` flag shortens **URLs** using the [is.gd] web service.  This means
  that long **URLs** are converted into shorter ones such as: [https://is.gd/g3QdWp](https://is.gd/g3QdWp)

  The `-n` flag specifies the number of articles to display.  By default, this is `10`.

  The `-o` flag specifies the [Reddit] article attribute to use for sorting the
  articles.  By default this should be `score`.  Note, if the `ORDERBY`
  parameter is `score`, then the articles should be ordered in **descending
  order**.  Otherwise, the articles should be ranked in **ascending order**.

  The `-t` flag specifies the maximum length for the articles' titles.  Titles
  longer than this value should be truncated.  The default value is `60`.

  #### <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Hints

  - Read the `TODO` comments carefully.  **DO NOT REMOVE THE [doctests]**!

  - `load_reddit_data`: To fetch the [Reddit] data, you can use the
    [requests.get] method.  You can then access the [JSON] data via the
    `json()` method of the object returned by [requests.get].  You will need to
    think carefully about what portion of the [JSON] you actually want to
    utilize.

  - `print_reddit_data`: To display the articles, this function can use the
    [sorted] function with either the `reverse` or `key` parameter to order the
    articles.  It can then **slice** the resulting articles to limit the number
    of things displayed.

      Note, a `tab` character is used to separate the `index` and the `title`
      and to indent the `url`.

      To sort by a particular field or attribute, you can take advantage of the
      `key` parameter of the [sorted] function:

          :::python
          articles = sorted(data, key=lambda i: i[field])

  - `shorten_url`: To shorten a **URL**, you can use the [requests.get] method
    to make a request to the [is.gd] webservice with the appropriate `params`
    as shown below:

          :::python
          requests.get(ISGD_URL, params={'format': 'json', 'url': url})

      You will need to parse the result of this request to extract the
      shortened **URL**.

  </div>

  ### Task 2: `test_reddit.sh`

  To aid you in testing the `reddit.py` script, we have provided you with
  `test_reddit.sh`, which you can use as follows:

      :::bash
      $ ./test_reddit.sh
      Testing reddit.py ...

         Score 5.00 / 5.00
        Status Success

  Note, we chose an **inactive** subreddit,
  [r/linuxactionshow](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxactionshow) for our test
  script since it should not change.  However, it is possible that it may
  change[^5] and thus break our test script.  Just let the staff know and
  adjustments can be made.

  [^5]: Please don't mess with this sub-reddit on purpose.  I'm looking at you `#csememers` (RIP).

  ## Activity 2: CSE Demographics (6 Points)

  One of the most pressing questions in Computer Science education is
  addressing the [lack of diversity] in computing.  In order to meanfully
  examine this issue, we will first need to look at some raw data.  For this
  activity, you are to a script, `demographics.py`, that downloads, processes,
  and visualizes the Computer Science and Engineering [demographic data] from
  the classes of **2013** through **2024**.

  [lack of diversity]:  https://blog.google/topics/education/racial-and-gender-gaps-computer-science-learning-new-google-gallup-research/

  #### <i class="fa fa-gavel"></i> Ethical and Professional Issues

  This assignment is inspired by a
  [discussion](https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.40175.fa19/reading04.html)
  we have in the [CSE 40175 Ethical and Professional Issues] class, which is a
  required course for all [Computer Science and Engineering] students.

  </div>

  ### Demographic Data

  Our beloved [Ramzi] has graciously provided us with the student [demographic
  data] for all [Computer Science and Engineering] students from the class of
  **2013** through **2024**.  This data looks something like this:

      :::text
      $ curl -sL https://yld.me/raw/fIRK | head -n 10
      Year,Gender,Ethnic
      2013,M,C
      2014,M,C
      2015,F,N
      2016,F,N
      2017,M,C
      2018,M,C
      2013,M,C
      2014,M,S
      2015,M,C

  As can be seen above, the demographics [CSV] data has three columns:

  1. The first column represents the graduating class year that student belongs
  to.

  1. The second column records the **gender** of the student and contains
  either `M` or `F` which stands for `Male` or `Female` respectively.

  2. The third column records the **ethnicity** of the student and consists of
  the following mapping:

      <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
        <thead>
          <th>Letter</th>
          <th>Ethnicity</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>Caucasian</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>O</td>

            <td>Black or African American</td>
          </tr>

  ### Task 1: `demographics.py`

  The `demographics.py` script takes the following arguments:

      :::bash
      # Display usage message
      $ ./demographics.py -h
      Usage: demographics.py [options] [URL]

          -y  YEARS   Which years to display (default: all)
          -p          Display data as percentages.
          -G          Do not include gender information.
          -E          Do not include ethnic information.

  The `-y` flag specifies which years to display (the default is to display all
  the years in the [CSV] data).

  The `-p` flag forces the script to output data as percentages rather than raw
  counts.

  The `-G` and `-E` flags suppresses outputting the gender and ethnic data
  respectively.

  The user may specify a `URL` to the [CSV] file.  If one is not specified then
  the script will use [https://yld.me/raw/fIRK](https://yld.me/raw/fIRK) as the
  `URL`.

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  **Note**, the years are always displayed in ascending order.
  </div>

  #### <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Hints

  - Read the `TODO` comments carefully.  **DO NOT REMOVE THE [doctests]**!

  - `load_demo_data`: To fetch the [demographic data], you can use the
    [requests.get] method.  You can then access the raw data via the `text`
    property of the object returned by [requests.get].  You will then need to
    organize the [CSV] data into a [dictionary] of the following format:

          :::text
          {"year": {"gender": count, "ethnic": count, "TOTAL": count}}

  - `print_demo_separator`: To display a separator line, this function should
    print 8 `char`s for each `year + 1`.  Consider using string multiplication:

          :::python
          print(' '*8)  # Prints 8 spaces

  - `print_demo_years`: To display the years, this function should use the
    start with a string with `4` spaces and then concatenate to this string
    each year formatted so it is right-aligned to `8` spaces.  You can
    accomplish alignment by doing the following:

          :::python
          # Print the value of variable aligned to the right and taking up at least 8 spaces
          print(f'{variable:>8}')

  - `print_demo_fields`: To display all the rows for a given list of `fields`,
    this function should build a row of text column by column.  Special care
    must be taken to display percentages versus raw counts.

  - `print_demo_data`: To display the table of data, this function should call
    the `print_demo_years` and `print_demo_separator` functions, followed by
    the `print_demo_gender` and `print_demo_ethnic` functions if necessary.

  - `print_demo_gender`: This function simply calls the `print_demo_fields` and
    `print_demo_separator` functions and is provided to you.

  - `print_demo_ethnic`: This function simply calls the `print_demo_fields` and
    `print_demo_separator` functions and is provided to you.

  #### <i class="fa fa-gears"></i> Iterative and incremental development

  Do not try to implement everything at once. Instead, approach this activity
  with the [iterative and incremental
  development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development)
  mindset and slowly build pieces of your application one feature at a time:

  1. Parse the program arguments.

  2. Fetch the data from the specified **URL** and organize into a
  [dictionary].

  3. Write the table header.

  4. Write one table row based on a field.

  **Remember** that the goal at the end of each iteration is that you have a
  **working** program that successfully implements all of the features up to
  that point.

  Focus on **one thing at a time** and feel free to write small **test code**
  to try things out.

  ## Activity 3: Quiz (1 Point)

  Once you have completed all the activities above, you are to complete the
  following **reflection quiz**:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/homework05.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  As with [Reading 01], you will need to store your answers in a
  `homework04/answers.json` file.  You can use the form above to generate the
  contents of this file, or you can write the [JSON] by hand.

  To test your quiz, you can use the `check.py` script:

      :::bash
      $ ../.scripts/check.py
      Checking homework05 quiz ...
           Q01 0.40
           Q02 0.60
         Score 1.00 / 1.00
        Status Success

  ## Guru Point (1 Point)

  For extra credit, you are to visualize the CSE demographics data above as
  graphical plots using [Python] and [matplotlib] inside a [Jupyter] notebook.
  You should produce graphs like these:

  <div class="thumbnail">
      <img src="static/img/gender-2024.png">
  </div>

  <div class="thumbnail">
      <img src="static/img/ethnic-2024.png">
  </div>

  To run [Jupyter] on the **student machines**:, you can use the following command:

      :::bash
      $ jupyter-notebook-3.9 --ip studentXX.cse.nd.edu --port 9000 --no-browser

  Replace `studentXX.cse.nd.edu` with the name of the student machine you are
  on.  Also, you may need to change the port to something else between `9000` -
  `9999`.

  ## Submission

  To submit your assignment, please commit your work to the `homework05` folder
  of your `homework05` branch in your **assignments** [GitHub] repository.
  Your `homework04` folder should only contain the following files:

  - `Makefile`
  - `answers.json`
  - `demographics.py`
  - `reddit.py`

  **Note**: You do not need to commit the test scripts because the `Makefile`
  automatically downloads them.

  #### <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Pull Request
  Remember to create a **Pull Request** and assign the appropriate TA from the
  [Reading 06 TA List].

  **DO NOT MERGE** your own **Pull Request**.  The TAs use open **Pull
  Requests** to keep track of which assignments to grade.  Closing them
  yourself will cause a delay in grading and confuse the TAs.
